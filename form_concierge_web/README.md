A Jaspr web application for survey forms with Serverpod.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Jaspr web application that is using
Serverpod.

A great starting point for learning Jaspr is the documentation site at:

This project uses Tailwind CSS. See the installation instructions at:

To run the project, first make sure that the server is running, then do:

    jaspr serve --port 8000
